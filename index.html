        <h2>Project Background</h2>
        <p>Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) accounts for approximately one-third of the worldâ€™s fish catch, or 11-26 million tons per year. Because of this, detecting and stopping IUU fishing is a top priority of law enforcement all over the world. Currently very few predictive models exist to detect illegal fishing, and this act is often times only caught through the physical search and seizure by law enforcement personnel.</p>
        <p>Lockheed Martin determined it beneficial to study and create a predictive model of illegal fishing, using cutting edge geospatial and sensor based detection data to characterize and flag vessels of interest. The George Mason team took openly available AIS data and created a model capable of determining:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>If the vessel was exhibiting fishing behavior, and</li>
            <li>Whether or not the vessel was conducting suspicious fishing behavior in an area regulated such as
            <ul>
              <li>EEZs</li>
              <li>RFMOs</li>
              <li>MPAs</li>
            </ul>
          </ol>
        <p>The model flags vessels of interest for further examination by law enforcement personnel.</p>
        <p>Future expansion of this model will lead to greater accuracy in finding all IUU activity, in order to further this expansion, data sources were documented and many different illegal fishing activities were modeled and required data sources documented to provide a clear path forward.</p>

        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>This project will develop and refine a model, or series of models, that progresses towards an all-encompassing illegal fishing enterprise model. The project will determine what legal fishing looks like, in order to build a model capable of predicting if illegal fishing is occurring. Currently no complete model of this type exists in order to aid law enforcement personnel responsible for patrolling the Eastern Pacific waters.</p>

        <h2>Project Benefits</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Acts as an aid to law enforcement personnel</li>
          <li>Lays the foundation for an all-encompassing illegal fishing model</li>
          <li>Techniques can be applied to other problems facing national defense</li>
